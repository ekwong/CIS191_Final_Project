# CIS191_Final_Project

We plan to create a coursework/organization system that will increase productivity when using a computer. There are many small tasks that detract from efficiency when working - especially in college. The general approach to our project considers a few of these smaller unproductive tasks that could be automated/improved and amalgamates all of them into a single program that has multiple functions. It should be considered as a general course management tool that encompasses tasks from start to submission of assignments, management of course materials and tools to simplify interaction of these course materials.


## Components:

- To do list: It has reminders for course related tasks - HWs, exams, presentations. This will allow for increased efficiency when working since reminders are linked directly to folders so all the work ‘to do’ will be available to you from one place.

- Add a task to your To-Do list along with a due date

  ```
  todo add task due_date
  ```

- Remove a task from your To-Do list

  ```
  todo delete task
  ```

- List all your tasks and due dates

  ```
  todo list
  ```

- Change the due date on one of your tasks

  ```
  todo update task due_date
  ```

- Dropbox sync class folders: Keeping backups of one’s work can be very tedious. Some cloud services allow for a desktop folder and anything save in that folder will be backed up. Why not integrate this throughout your system and allow for any folder to be backed up from anywhere on your computer? Furthermore, at the end of a semester, you may not want to delete all your completed course files but rather, back them up and archive them to free up local storage.

- Organization commands: Nowadays, all coursework is available online to download to one's local machine however what ends up happening with these downloaded files is that they stay in the downloads folder - cluttering it up with files from different courses. An organizer will allow for a single command to move all homework files to their respective homework folder in their course folder and sort files by class as well as relation to class e.g. homework/notes/coursework. 

- Email Submission: Many classes require assignments to be submitted to a TA or professor over email. Opening up a browser, attaching files and typing up a body can all be automated into a single command that submits your files to your professor without ever having to open up your email client.
